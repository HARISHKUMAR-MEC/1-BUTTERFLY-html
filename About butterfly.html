    <i><p><b>Butterflies</b> are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often
        brightly coloured wings that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight. 
        The group comprises the superfamilies Hedyloidea (moth-butterflies in the Americas) and Papilionoidea 
        (all others). The oldest butterfly fossils have been dated to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago, 
        though they likely originated in the Late Cretaceous, about <u>101 million years ago.</u></p>
        <p>Butterflies have a four-stage life cycle, and like other holometabolous insects they undergo complete 
        metamorphosis. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, 
        will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a 
        chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, expands 
        its wings to dry, and flies off.<mark>Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a 
        single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire 
        life cycle.</mark>Butterflies are often polymorphic, and many species make use of camouflage, mimicry, 
        and aposematism to evade their predators.</p>
        <p>Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many butterflies are 
        attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps,protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or 
        are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can 
        damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of 
        a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while 
        others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in 
        the visual and literary arts. The Smithsonian Institution says "butterflies are certainly one of the 
        most appealing creatures in nature".</p></i>
        <h2><b>Paleontology</b></h2>
        <p><i>The earliest Lepidoptera fossils date to the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, around 200 million years 
            ago. Butterflies evolved from moths, so while the butterflies are monophyletic (forming a singleade),
            the moths are not. The oldest known butterfly is Protocoeliades kristenseni from the Palaeocene aged Fur
            Formation of Denmark, approximately 55 million years old, which belongs to the family Hesperiidae 
            (skippers). Molecular clock estimates suggest that butterflies originated sometime in the Late
            Cretaceous, but only significantly diversified during the Cenozoic, with one study suggesting 
            a North American origin for the group. The oldest American butterfly is the Late Eocene Prodryas
            persephone from the Florissant Fossil Beds, approximately 34 million years old.</i></p>

        <h2><b>Life Cycle</b></h2>
        <p><i>Butterflies in their adult stage can live from a week to nearly a year depending on the species. 
            Many species have long larval life stages while others can remain dormant in their pupal or egg 
            stages and thereby survive winters. The Melissa Arctic (Oeneis melissa) overwinters twice as a 
            caterpillar. Butterflies may have one or more broods per year. The number of generations per
            year varies from temperate to tropical regions with tropical regions showing a trend towards multivoltinism.</i></p>

        <p><i>Courtship is often aerial and often involves pheromones. Butterflies then land on the ground or 
            on a perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. 
            Simple photoreceptor cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult 
            behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may 
            cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital 
            opening to prevent her from mating again.
        <p><i>The vast majority of butterflies have a four-stage life cycle: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa 
            (chrysalis) and imago (adult). In the genera Colias, Erebia, Euchloe, and Parnassius, a small 
            number of species are known that reproduce semi-parthenogenetically; when the female dies, a 
            partially developed larva emerges from her abdomen.</i></p>
        <b><h2>Eggs</h2></b>
        <p><i>Butterfly eggs are protected by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. 
            This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva 
            has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one 
            end, called micropyles; the purpose of these holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the 
            egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and 
            finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between 
            one hundred and two hundred eggs.
            <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/2012-06-27_Aporia_crataegi_eggs_Malus_domestica.JPG/800px-2012-06-27_Aporia_crataegi_eggs_Malus_domestica.JPG" alt="butterfly" style="width:500px;height:400px;"></center>

            Butterfly eggs are fixed to a leaf with a special glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it 
            contracts, deforming the shape of the egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every 
            egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched but in the case of 
            Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. 
            This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material 
            which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf; 
            instead, the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.</i></p>
        <h2><b>Caterpillar larva</b></h2>
        <p><i>Butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant leaves and spend practically all of their time 
            searching for and eating food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are 
            predators: Spalgis epius eats scale insects, while lycaenids such as Liphyra brassolis are 
            myrmecophilous, eating <sup>ant</sup> larvae.<i></p>
            <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Papilionidae_-_Papilio_machaon-2.JPG" alt="butterfly" style="width:500px;height:400px;"></center>
        <p><i>Caterpillars mature through a series of developmental stages known as instars. Near the end of 
            each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of 
            neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and 
            specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to 
            form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new 
            cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns
            begins by the last larval instar.</i></p>
            <hr>
        <h2><b>pupa</b></h2>
        <p><i>When the larva is fully grown, hormones such as prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) are produced.
            At this point the larva stops feeding, and begins "wandering" in the quest for a suitable pupation
            site, often the underside of a leaf or other concealed location. There it spins a button of silk which
            it uses to fasten its body to the surface and moults for a final time. While some caterpillars spin a 
            cocoon to protect the pupa, most species do not. The naked pupa, often known as a chrysalis, usually hangs 
            head down from the cremaster, a spiny pad at the posterior end, but in some species a silken girdle may
            be spun to keep the pupa in a head-up position.Most of the tissues and cells of the larva are broken
            down inside the pupa, as the constituent material is rebuilt into the imago. The structure of the 
            transforming insect is visible from the exterior, with the wings folded flat on the ventral surface and 
            the two halves of the proboscis, with the antennae and the legs between them.</i></p>
            <center><img src="https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/143/106/430/beauty-butterfly-cocoon-digital-wallpaper-preview.jpg" alt="butterfly" style="width:500px;height:400px;"></center>
        <p><i>The pupal transformation into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind.
            To transform from the miniature wings visible on the outside of the pupa into large structures usable 
            for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is
            surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms 
            a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it
            grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult
            colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription 
            factors in the early pupa.</i></p>
            <hr>
        <h2><b>Adult</b></h2>
        <p><i>The reproductive stage of the insect is the winged adult or imago. The surface of both 
            butterflies and moths is covered by scales, each of which is an outgrowth from a single epidermal
            cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of 
            distinguishing flower shapes or motion but cannot view distant objects clearly. Colour perception
            is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed 
            of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae).
            The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are 
            located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are adapted to sucking and the mandibles 
            are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis 
            which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear 
            <sub>palps</sub> which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps 
            and do not feed as adults.</i></p>
        <center><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/76/151376-050-13586FE2/monarch-butterfly-flowers-bush.jpg" alt="butterfly" style="width:500px;height:400px;"></center>

        <p><i>Many Heliconius butterflies also use their proboscis to feed on pollen; in these species 
            only 20% of the amino acids used in reproduction come from larval feeding, which allow them to 
            develop more quickly as caterpillars, and gives them a longer lifespan of several months as adults.
            The thorax of the butterfly is devoted to locomotion. Each of the three thoracic segments has 
            two legs (among nymphalids, the first pair is reduced and the insects walk on four legs). 
            The second and third segments of the thorax bear the wings. The leading edges of the forewings
            have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have
            fewer stiffening veins. The forewings and hindwings are not hooked together (as they are in moths) 
            but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts. The front two segments have a pair 
            of spiracles which are used in respiration.</i></p>
